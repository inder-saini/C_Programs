In this Repository, the first file I have attached is the hashTable program which I have been working on for a week. In this program I took advantage of C programming and its characteristics like pointers, dynamic programming and more. 

In the HashTable data structure, we try to add,search, dleet elements which happen in O(n) time.
Also, to avoid hashing of keys to same index. We created OverflowBuckets (which is nothing the representation of a LinkedList) to chain the elements which point to same index, in this way we can avoid hash collission.
